I took screenshots of the course videos.

You can see these screenshots on: [docx](https://github.com/cyberfoxmeow/my-binary-assets-for-UOL-bsccs-online-courses/blob/main/ads2%20video%20screenshots/ads2%20video%20screenshots%20by%20cyberfox_meow.docx), which is a Word file stored in my own github repository so you do not need to worry the broken link problem.
