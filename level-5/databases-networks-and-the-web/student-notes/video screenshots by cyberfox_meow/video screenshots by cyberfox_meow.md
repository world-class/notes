I took screenshots of the course videos from week 3.

You can see these screenshots on: [docx](https://github.com/cyberfoxmeow/my-binary-assets-for-UOL-bsccs-online-courses/blob/main/dnw%20video%20screenshots/dnw%20video%20screenshots%20by%20cyberfox_meow.docx) . 

The screenshots are stored in a Word file in my own github repositories
