# World Class Course Notes

This repository contains course notes for the different modules part
of the BSc. CS degree from Univerity of London.

Most of the work is created by students who have contributed their
collected course notes to this repository to share with the rest of
the community.

You're free to use these notes for your own studies but no guarantees
are given, not even the guarantee that the content is correct and
matches the course.

# Contributing

When contributing your own course notes, make sure they're not too
large as that makes it difficult for students who want to start
contributing in the future.

For now, there are no enforced rules, but as an example, we have
course notes for entire semester of a course fitting in less than
1MiB.
